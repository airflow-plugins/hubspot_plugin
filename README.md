# Plugin - Hubspot to S3

This plugin moves data from the [Hubspot](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/overview) API to S3 or GCS based on the specified object

## Hooks
### HubspotHook
This hook handles the authentication and request to Hubspot. This extends the HttpHook.

### S3Hook
[Core Airflow S3Hook](https://pythonhosted.org/airflow/_modules/S3_hook.html) with the standard boto dependency.

## Operators
### HubspotToS3Operator
This operator composes the logic for this plugin. It fetches the Hubpsot specified object and saves the result in a S3 Bucket, under a specified key, in
njson format. The parameters it can accept include the following.

#### NOTE: A number of endpoints have nested arrays that are moved into their own table. In situations like this, the secondary table will have the prefix of the main Hubspot object.

  Example: The "Form Submissions" list of dictionaries in the contacts object will become it's own table with the label "contacts_form_submissions".
